## QUESTION 1

1. List and explain the different ways to join datasets.
    1. Inner Join:
        1. An inner join combines rows from two datasets based on a common key and includes only the rows with matching values in both datasets.
        2. Rows with non-matching keys in either dataset are excluded from the result.
    2. Outer Join:
        1. An outer join combines rows from both datasets, including all rows from both datasets.
        2. Rows with matching keys are combined into a single row, while rows with non-matching keys are included with NaN values in the columns from the dataset where there is no match.
    3. Left Join:
        1. A left join combines rows from the left dataset with matching rows from the right dataset based on a common key.
        2. All rows from the left dataset are included in the result, even if there are no matching rows in the right dataset.
